                            <p>Apartment hunting can be challenging to visit all potential locations, and many existing
                                apartment
                                listing websites overwhelm and confuse users with excessive details. This can lead to
                                frustration and wasted time for users who are trying to find the perfect apartment that
                                meets their needs. </p>
                        </div>

                            <h4>Solution</h4>

                            <p>To address the challenges of apartment hunting, I aimed to design a solution that
                                simplifies the search process,
                                enabling users to quickly and easily find apartments that meet their preferences. This
                                led to the creation of HomeHubToronto,
                                a website that offers streamlined search and filtering options, as well as the ability
                                to schedule visits with just one click.
                                HomeHubToronto is designed to make apartment hunting
                                a stress-free experience for users, allowing them to focus on finding their ideal home
                                without being overwhelmed by excessive details or a complicated search process.</p>

                            <h4>Brainstorm & Ideation</h4>
                            <p>Apartment hunting can be a time-consuming and challenging process for many people as it
                                often requires extensive
                                research and scheduling visits to numerous locations. However, with the HomeHubToronto
                                platform, users can enjoy
                                a streamlined and hassle-free apartment search experience. HomeHubToronto offers
                                detailed information about apartment locations,
                                including nearby transit options and neighborhood details, to help users make informed
                                decisions quickly and easily.
                                By providing comprehensive information upfront, HomeHubToronto eliminates the need for
                                users to schedule visits to multiple locations,
                                saving them valuable time and effort. Overall, HomeHubToronto is designed to provide a
                                fast and easy apartment search experience,
                                helping users find their perfect home with minimal hassle.</p>
                            <p>Based on that, I did user research based on IDEO card sorting methods, including
                                secondary research, interview and survey to define our main target users and features.

                                <li>People prefer having access to comprehensive information about an apartment,
                                    including visual media such as images and videos, details about its location and
                                    proximity to public transportation,
                                    as well as information about the surrounding neighborhood prior to visiting in
                                    person.</li>
                                <li>Many people prefer virtual apartment tours as it allows them to save time and avoid
                                    the hassle of traveling, while still providing an opportunity to view the space in
                                    detail.</li>
                            </ol>

                                My goal here was to make strategic information architecture decisions that would improve overall website navigation.
